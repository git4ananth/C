**Practise Problem Set - 2**

1. **Countries**
   Suppose Richard wish to enter a list of country name into the computer, rearrange them into alphabetical order, and then display the rearranged list. Richard made the skeletal of the C program shown below. Complete the function reorder(int n, char \*x[])to help Richard for his task.

2. **Day Name**
   Write a function day_name() that receive a number n and return a pointer to a character string containing the name of the corresponding day. The day names should be kept in a static table of character strings local to the function.

3. **Valedictory**
   A Valedictory function has been arranged to greet the Highest paid salary employee to encourage his efforts Write a C program to accept details of 'n' Employee (E. No, Emp Name, Salary) and display the details of employee having highest salary. Use array of structure.

4. **Library**
   Write a menu driven program in 'C' which shows the working of library. The menu option
   should be
   1. Add book details.
   2. Display book details.
   3. List all books of given author.
   4. List the count of books in the library.
   5. Exit
5. **Squirrel & Chestnut Trees**
   There are n squirrel(s) waiting below the feet of m chestnut tree(s). The first chestnut of the i-th tree will fall right after Ti second(s), and one more every Pi second(s) after that. The “big mama” of squirrels wants them to bring their nest no less than k chestnuts to avoid the big storm coming, as fast as possible! So they are discussing to wait below which trees to take enough chestnuts in the shortest time. Time to move to the positions is zero, and the squirrels move nowhere after that. Request-> Use the pointer concept to calculate the shortest time (how many seconds more) the squirrels can take enough chestnuts.

6. **Delete all Occurences of a letter in a string**
   Using pointer, write a C program that reads a character string and a character as input and deletes all occurrence of this character in the string. The program should display the corrected string with no holes.

7. **Q7**
   Complete the function void update(int *a,int *b). It receives two integer pointers, int* a and int* b. Set the value of to their product, and to their sum. There is no return value, and no return statement is needed.
